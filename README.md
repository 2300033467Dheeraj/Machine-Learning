Machine Learning 🚀
I have learned Machine Learning from the Code Pulse platform, which has helped me enhance my technical skills. This journey allowed me to gain hands-on experience with key ML concepts, improving both my understanding and practical implementation abilities.

Through this learning process, I covered essential Machine Learning topics, including:
✅ Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN)
✅ Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN)
✅ Regression Analysis (Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, Non-Linear Regression)
✅ Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM)
✅ Clustering Methods (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
✅ Recommender Systems (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)
✅ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
✅ Error Metrics & Performance Evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score)

This learning experience was a crucial part of my internship, helping me build real-world ML models and boosting my resume.
